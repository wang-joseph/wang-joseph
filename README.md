  Hi there! I'm Joseph Wang, a grade 12 student currently in Richmond Hill High School in Ontario, Canada. 
  <br /><br />
  If you're reading this, chances are you're an RHHS student too, in which case hello there! I hope this README helps you understand me a bit more, so that you can properly address me as "that one guy who has a github that he obnoxiously put everywhere". In the odd case that you might be an employer, hackathon organizer, or my mother, I promise that I can write a lot more formally. A job would be nice. Please hire me.
  <br /><br />
  I use Python a lot, but I also use JS/TS, and Java (My Java projects are mostly school projects though). Outside of what's shown here, I also learn and dabble occasionally in Julia, C, and Kotlin (nothing pushed to GitHub though).

  <br />

  <!-- I hope I don't come off as quite boring! Maybe I should spaz this section up with emojis—it's what all the cool kids seem to be doing. -->
  I'm honestly a very on-off kind of programmer. Some days I'll be working till 4am without sleep and other days I play *Terraria* all day, still without sleep. If you enjoy coin flips and the like, try playing the game "will my wakatime show 200 hours or nothing?"
  <br />
  
  Other than that, I do enjoy doing some other things. A few hobbies include gaming (of course), music production, using dark mode (get it cause lightmode bad), and sleeping! 
  
  I also try to do some PRs and the like (contributing to open source!!), but I tend to do more personal projects... I aspire to one day have the technical know-how to confidently contribute to the open source community, though!

<!-- GitHub streak! This is cool, although it'll stay at 0 for quite some time. Newlines around seem to be necessary, but I haven't the foggiest why. Probably some specification on the markdown flavouring that I haven't bothered to read! -->

## Languages

<details>
  <summary>
    Let's talk languages! If you haven't skipped over like half this README, you'll know that I am a huge fan of Python but Typescript is pretty fun too (more like I've been forced to use it too much). Here are some frameworks and languages I know how to use, minus any esoteric ones that I pick up for like 30 minutes and then forget completely (I'm looking at you, 🏁 🍇).

<!-- The real meat of this github thingy, or so I hope... I don't actually have a lot of projects, yet! -->
## Projects

<details>
  <summary> I do occasional small projects, but honestly a lot of my projects scream "google drive but for code". Most of the projects I work on generally aren't my own repos, but someone else's repo that I contribute to. Here are some that I like. </summary>

<!-- Ahhh, hackathons! Fun fact: I actually only included CTFS in here because I needed one more repo to fill the space or my formatting would break. -->
### Hackathons & CTFs
<details>
  <summary> I also do hackathons sometimes and they're pretty fun. I've been to four so far - Hack the North 2019, MHacks 12, UOttahack3, and Hack the North 2020++. Hack the North 2020++ was my most recent and the first virtual hackathon I've ever been to, and that was pretty enjoyable... If only I didn't have school work. I've also done a few CTFs, but currently only have partially completed writeups for one CTF: PicoCTF 2021. You can see the repos here. </summary>

Now that I think about it, the majority of the pins here are already pinned on my profile... too bad!
Other than that, that's pretty much it. Check out some of my friend/people I've worked with's profiles I guess (hope they don't mind me throwing them in here).

Bam, visitor counter. Super fun trick: If you refresh 50 times, you get to see this counter increment at astonishing rates!
